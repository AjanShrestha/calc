A small project to introduce TDD


* Free software: MIT license
* Documentation: https://calc.readthedocs.io.


TDD Rules
--------

1. Test first, code later
2. Add the reasonably minimum amount of code you need to pass the tests
3. You shouldn't have more than one failing test at a time
4. Write code that passes the test. Then refactor it.

Run Tests
--------

    ``bash
    py.test -svv
    ``
